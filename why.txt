From your 10 commandments (https://www.deus.ai/research) and your approach (https://www.deus.ai/deus-services) it's clear that you have a specific vision which I share: in particular, I started to study and research on federated learning while I was in the university cause I already knew that in a real world scenario the data are not clean and well stored, so maybe the most important phase of a machine learning pipeline is to understand, gather and preprocess them, before rushing looking for the best massive neural network architecture.

I also believe that since machine learning and AI are a trend, there is a lack of information about it, so explain how this field works is fundamental to get well working algorithms, instead of blinding apply models without even knowing why they works. 
For example, in my current project the gaussian processes work better than some neural networks, and as my professor used to say "people apply neural networks without trying a linear regression, which sometimes works better". 

I am interested in creating value, cause I think that building a product would be much more satisfactory than doing research without a specific direction.

For the artificial intelligence course I attended during the first lockdown, I tried to develop a model able to predict the trajectory of the pedestrians, cause I was thinking about a bigger project: build a robot for the assistance in an hospital. 

I'm very touched by the hot topic of the women in STEM, and I think that the recruitment process of a company is a fertile ground for a discussion about ethics. I'd like to work on this challenge without necessary automatizing the entire process, but understanding which are the right values to take into account... https://www.deus.ai/work/global-energy-company

Also, I like the idea shown in https://www.deus.ai/post/designing-a-more-inclusive-museum-experience cause last week I was visiting Micropia and many other museums, and I started to think what's the optimized way to place all the interesting sites in a fixed area in order to meet the needs of disable people or children (the description panels, the highness of some attractions, the available space to move...)

Finally, the main reasons I would like to join you for an internship are:
- I would like to work on a challenge, guided by a senior, since for the project I am working on at the moment, I am the only machine learning "expert" in the lab, so I cannot discuss about my doubts, and I understood the value of working with experts' feedbacks
- I would like to live in Netherlands for a period cause among the different european countries I visited it is the most quiet and with well-educated people, which is very important to me (I don't mind the weather: I am in Ireland right now). I wanna understand if it is the right place for me to invest, for the future

(my work agreement will expire on june so I have to choose now if I wanna stay here or move, and here there are no interesting machine learning path I can join)
